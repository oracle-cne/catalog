# kube-prometheus-stack

Installs the [kube-prometheus stack](https://github.com//kube-prometheus), a collection of Kubernetes manifests, [Grafana](http://grafana.com/) dashboards, and [Prometheus rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) using the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).

See the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com//kube-prometheus) README for details about components, dashboards, and alerts.

_Note: This chart was formerly named `` chart, now renamed to more clearly reflect that it installs the `kube-prometheus` project stack, within which Prometheus Operator is only one component._

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.16+

## Install The Application

```console
ocne application install --release [RELEASE_NAME] --name kube-prometheus-stack --namespace [NAMESPACE]
```
## Uninstall The Application

```console
ocne application uninstall --release [RELEASE_NAME] --namespace [NAMESPACE]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

CRDs created by this chart are not removed by default and should be manually cleaned up:

```console
kubectl delete crd alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd probes.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd thanosrulers.monitoring.coreos.com
```

### Multiple releases

The same chart can be used to run multiple Prometheus instances in the same cluster if required. To achieve this, it is necessary to run only one instance of  and a pair of alertmanager pods for an HA configuration, while all other components need to be disabled. To disable a dependency during installation, set `kubeStateMetrics.enabled`, `nodeExporter.enabled` and `grafana.enabled` to `false`.

## Work-Arounds for Known Issues

### Running on private GKE clusters

When Google configure the control plane for private clusters, they automatically configure VPC peering between your Kubernetes clusterâ€™s network and a separate Google managed project. In order to restrict what Google are able to access within your cluster, the firewall rules configured restrict access to your Kubernetes pods. This means that in order to use the webhook component with a GKE private cluster, you must configure an additional firewall rule to allow the GKE control plane access to your webhook pod.

You can read more information on how to add firewall rules for the GKE control plane nodes in the [GKE docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules)

Alternatively, you can disable the hooks by setting `prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false`.

## PrometheusRules Admission Webhooks

With Prometheus Operator version 0.30+, the core Prometheus Operator pod exposes an endpoint that will integrate with the `validatingwebhookconfiguration` Kubernetes feature to prevent malformed rules from being added to the cluster.

### How the Chart Configures the Hooks

A validating and mutating webhook configuration requires the endpoint to which the request is sent to use TLS. It is possible to set up custom certificates to do this, but in most cases, a self-signed certificate is enough. The setup of this component requires some more complex orchestration when using helm. The steps are created to be idempotent and to allow turning the feature on and off without running into helm quirks.

1. A pre-install hook provisions a certificate into the same namespace using a format compatible with provisioning using end user certificates. If the certificate already exists, the hook exits.
2. The prometheus operator pod is configured to use a TLS proxy container, which will load that certificate.
3. Validating and Mutating webhook configurations are created in the cluster, with their failure mode set to Ignore. This allows rules to be created by the same chart at the same time, even though the webhook has not yet been fully set up - it does not have the correct CA field set.
4. A post-install hook reads the CA from the secret created by step 1 and patches the Validating and Mutating webhook configurations. This process will allow a custom CA provisioned by some other process to also be patched into the webhook configurations. The chosen failure policy is also patched into the webhook configurations

### Limitations

Because the operator can only run as a single pod, there is potential for this component failure to cause rule deployment failure. Because this risk is outweighed by the benefit of having validation, the feature is enabled by default.

## Developing Prometheus Rules and Grafana Dashboards

This chart Grafana Dashboards and Prometheus Rules are just a copy from [/prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) and other sources, synced (with alterations) by scripts in [hack](hack) folder. In order to introduce any changes you need to first [add them to the original repository](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/main/docs/customizations/developing-prometheus-rules-and-grafana-dashboards.md) and then sync there by scripts.

## Further Information

## prometheus.io/scrape

The prometheus operator does not support annotation-based discovery of services, using the `PodMonitor` or `ServiceMonitor` CRD in its place as they provide far more configuration options.
For information on how to use PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors, please see the documentation on the `/prometheus-operator` documentation here:

- [ServiceMonitors](https://github.com//prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#include-servicemonitors)
- [PodMonitors](https://github.com//prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#include-podmonitors)
- [Running Exporters](https://github.com//prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/user-guides/running-exporters.md)

By default, Prometheus discovers PodMonitors and ServiceMonitors within its namespace, that are labeled with the same release tag as the  release.
Sometimes, you may need to discover custom PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors, for example used to scrape data from third-party applications.
An easy way of doing this, without compromising the default PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors discovery, is allowing Prometheus to discover all PodMonitors/ServiceMonitors within its namespace, without applying label filtering.
To do so, you can set `prometheus.prometheusSpec.podMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues` and `prometheus.prometheusSpec.serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues` to `false`.
