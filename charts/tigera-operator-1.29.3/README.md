# Calico

Calico is a widely adopted, battle-tested open source networking and network security solution for Kubernetes, virtual machines, and bare-metal workloads.
Calico provides two major services for Cloud Native applications:

- Network connectivity between workloads.
- Network security policy enforcement between workloads.

Calicoâ€™s flexible architecture supports a wide range of deployment options, using modular components and technologies, including:

- Choice of data plane technology, whether it be [eBPF](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/maintenance/ebpf/use-cases-ebpf), standard Linux, [Windows HNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/container-networking/architecture) or [VPP](https://github.com/projectcalico/vpp-dataplane)
- Enforcement of the full set of Kubernetes network policy features, plus for those needing a richer set of policy features, Calico network policies.
- An optimized Kubernetes Service implementation using eBPF.
- Kubernetes [apiserver integration](./apiserver), for managing Calico configuration and Calico network policies.
- Both non-overlay and [overlay (via IPIP or VXLAN)](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/networking/vxlan-ipip) networking options in either public cloud or on-prem deployments.
- [CNI plugins](./cni-plugin) for Kubernetes to provide highly efficient pod networking and IP Address Management (IPAM).
- A [BGP routing stack](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/networking/bgp) that can advertise routes for workload and service IP addresses to physical network infrastructure.

# Installing

Install the application

```
ocne application install --release calico --name tigera-operator --namespace tigera-operator
```
